file_format: "1"
id: frame84
name: frame84
type: shield

url: https://github.com/Kcanady21/zmk-config

features:
  - keys
  - studio

requires:
  - nice_nano_v2
```

**Key changes from what you had:**

1. Changed `requires: pro_micro` to `requires: nice_nano_v2` - this should match your actual hardware
2. Kept `studio` in the features list
3. Updated the URL to point to your actual GitHub repo (optional, but cleaner than "example.com")

**And your `frame84.conf` should be:**
```
# Enable USB HID support
CONFIG_ZMK_USB=y

# Enable ZMK Studio
CONFIG_ZMK_STUDIO=y
